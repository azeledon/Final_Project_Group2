## Project Overview

This project will analyze retail sales, including product types, customer details, count of orders, etc. This topic was selected by group consensus that sales was an interesting topic and has the ability to be predictable and forecasted. When examining sales, the dataset may suggest that certain products are more susceptible to lower sales. Retail sales are broad enough to leverage many processes such as SQL, Python, API lines, ETL, and much more; which ultimately allowed for a free range of manipulating the dataset to further the study. With many variables, product types, product colors, count of products purchased, and customer details. The dataset is largely available for the exploration of many questions and hypotheses.

In today's highly competitive market, businesses need to have a comprehensive understanding of their customers, sales trends, and product performance to remain successful. The goal of this project is to analyze e-commerce sales data using various analytical techniques and tools to gain insights into customer behavior, sales trends, and revenue generation. Furthermore, the insights gained from this project will help the online businesses identify their top-performing products, target their marketing efforts more effectively, and optimize their sales strategies to increase revenue and customer satisfaction.

## Objectives

1. Analyze the customer behavior and trends.
2. Determine the popular products and categories.
3. Identify the revenue generation patterns and trends.
4. Create predictive models to forecast future sales, customer churn, and customer lifetime value.

## Methodology

- **Data Exploration:** Explore the customer orders and sales data to identify any patterns, trends, or outliers that may be useful for analysis using Python and SQL.
- **Data Cleaning:** Clean and preprocess the data, including handling missing or invalid values, converting data types, and merging tables as needed using Python and SQL.
- **Data Analysis:** Conduct exploratory data analysis and perform statistical analysis to identify key insights and trends in the data using Python and SQL.

They will use programming languages such as Python and R to develop these models and test their accuracy. The Data Scientist will collaborate with the Data Analyst to ensure that the data is clean and properly prepared for modeling. They will also work closely with the Tableau Developer to create interactive visualizations that effectively communicate the results of the predictive modeling.

- **Tableau Developer:** This person will be responsible for creating interactive and dynamic visualizations using Tableau that effectively communicate key findings and insights from the data analysis and predictive modeling. They will work closely with the Data Analyst and Data Scientist to identify the most important insights to communicate and the best way to display them. The Tableau Developer will also create a dashboard that provides a comprehensive overview of the data analysis and predictive modeling results.

- **Project Manager:** This person will be responsible for managing the overall project and ensuring that it is completed on time and within budget. They will work closely with all team members to ensure that each person's role is clearly defined and that everyone is meeting their deadlines. The Project Manager will also communicate with stakeholders to provide regular updates on the project's progress and ensure that their needs are being met.

## Project Phases

### 1. Data Collection 

Source of the data: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ruchi798/shopping-cart-database. 

The dataset contains four CSV files containing sales details for the 12 months of the year 2021.  Each file contains anywhere from 1000 to 5001  rows and 5-9  columns. The columns are as follows: customer id, customer name, gender, age, home address, zip code, city, state , country, order id, payment, order date, delivery date, sales id, product id, price per unite, quantity, total price, product type, product name, size, color, price, quantity.

### 2. Data Exploration

### Data Description

One important step in completing the project is to describe the data. Understanding the nature of the data will help team members determine the types of analysis that can be performed.

The dataset chosen for this project - Sales - was retrieved from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ruchi798/shopping-cart-database. It includes four tables containing sales details for the 12 months of 2021.

**Customers Information**

**Product Information**

**Sales Transactions**

### Demographic Information

To provide a comprehensive description of the data, the team used the "describe" function in a Jupyter notebook file. The analysis revealed several key aspects related to customers and orders:

- On average, customers were found to be 49.86 years old.
- The youngest customer to have made a purchase was 20 years old.
- The oldest customer was found to be 80 years old.
- The dataset included a total of 1000 orders.

Furthermore, the team analyzed the products and sales CSV files using the "describe" function in a Jupyter Notebook file. The findings are as follows:

- The average amount spent on a single product was found to be $103.50.
- Average price of products is $105.81
- The highest-priced product offered by the company was priced at $119.00.
- The least expensive product sold had a price of $90.00.
- The data indicated that no customer had purchased more than three items.
- The most popular item sold was purchased 80 times.
- Range of order dates was 2021-1-1 to 2021-9-9
- Range of prices per unit: $90.00-$119.00
- Range of quantities sold in sales data set: 1-3
- Average quantity of products sold per order: 1.99
- Most common product type in the product info data set:  Jacket

By analyzing this data, we can answer a variety of business-related questions and make informed decisions to improve sales performance. This goal will be achieved by using several programming languages and tools, including SQL, Python, R, and Tableau, to extract, clean, transform, and visualize the data. 

### Data Cleaning with Python 

To clean the data, we followed a systematic process that involved several steps. First, we assessed the data to identify any issues, such as missing values, duplicates, or errors. We then decided on a strategy for handling each of these issues.

For instance, if we found missing values, we might have chosen to impute them using statistical methods, such as mean or median imputation, or we might have dropped the affected rows. If we discovered duplicates, we might have removed them by keeping only the first occurrence of each record or by aggregating the data.

We also checked for inconsistent or incorrect data types, such as strings in numerical fields, and converted them to the appropriate data type. Additionally, we looked for outliers and decided whether to remove them or keep them depending on their significance to the analysis.

After applying these cleaning strategies, we verified the data to ensure that it was free from errors and inconsistencies. We ran data quality checks, such as checking for missing values, duplicates, and outliers. If any issues were still present, we revisited the cleaning process until the data met the desired quality standards.

**Python Tools used for Data Cleaning**

- **Jupyter Notebook:** To write and execute the Python code.

- **Pandas:** To perform data manipulation and analysis.

- **Matplotlib:** To create visualizations and plots for better understanding and analysis.

### ERD

We created an ERD using QuickDBD
